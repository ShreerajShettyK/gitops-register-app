In a continuous deployment (CD) pipeline, code changes automatically trigger deployment to production or other environments after passing through the necessary stages like testing and integration. GitOps is a paradigm that applies DevOps best practices using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application deployments.

ArgoCD is a continuous deployment tool that is Kubernetes-native, enabling GitOps for Kubernetes clusters. It automatically syncs the state of the cluster with the desired state defined in a Git repository.

In your setup, the gitops-register-app repository is being used to manage and deploy an application called "register-app" using GitOps principles.

Repository Structure and Components
Jenkinsfile:

Defines the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

Stages:

Cleanup Workspace: Clears the Jenkins workspace to ensure a clean environment for the build process.
Checkout from SCM: Retrieves the latest code from the main branch of your GitHub repository.
Update the Deployment Tags: Modifies the deployment.yaml file to update the image tag for the Docker container. The sed command is used to replace the image tag in the YAML file with the value of IMAGE_TAG (which needs to be passed as a parameter or environment variable).
Push the changed deployment file to Git: Commits the updated deployment.yaml file back to the Git repository.
Significance: This pipeline ensures that every time a new Docker image is built (presumably in another part of the Jenkins pipeline or another pipeline), the corresponding Kubernetes deployment manifest is updated with the new image tag. This updated manifest is then pushed back to the GitOps repository.

deployment.yaml:

A Kubernetes Deployment manifest file that defines the desired state of the application (register-app).
Components:
metadata: Defines the name of the deployment.
spec: Describes the desired number of replicas, the container image to be used, and resource limits.
Significance: This file is central to GitOps because it defines what the deployed application should look like. ArgoCD will monitor this file, and when it detects a change, it will apply the updates to the Kubernetes cluster.
service.yaml:

A Kubernetes Service manifest that exposes the application (register-app) to the network.
Components:
metadata: Defines the name and labels for the service.
spec: Describes how the service is exposed (via a LoadBalancer in this case) and which ports are exposed.
Significance: This file defines how the application is accessed by other services or users. Like deployment.yaml, any changes to this file will trigger a redeployment via ArgoCD.
ArgoCD and GitOps in Action
ArgoCD is configured to watch your gitops-register-app repository. The key process is as follows:

GitOps Workflow:

The source of truth for your application's state (including Kubernetes manifests) is maintained in the Git repository.
When changes are made to the deployment.yaml or service.yaml files (either manually or through an automated process like the Jenkins pipeline), those changes are committed to the main branch.
ArgoCD Sync:

ArgoCD continuously monitors the Git repository for changes.
Upon detecting a change, ArgoCD pulls the updated manifest files and applies them to the Kubernetes cluster.
If there are discrepancies between the live state in the cluster and the desired state in Git, ArgoCD will automatically bring the cluster's state in line with the Git repository (syncing the state).
Continuous Deployment:

The Jenkins pipeline updates the image tag in the deployment manifest with a new Docker image version.
After updating the deployment.yaml, it pushes these changes back to the Git repository.
ArgoCD detects these changes and triggers the deployment in the Kubernetes cluster, effectively updating the running application with the new version of the container.
Summary
In this setup, Jenkins handles the continuous integration aspect by building Docker images and updating Kubernetes manifests. ArgoCD takes care of the continuous deployment by ensuring that any changes committed to the gitops-register-app repository are applied to the Kubernetes cluster, maintaining the desired state as defined in Git.
